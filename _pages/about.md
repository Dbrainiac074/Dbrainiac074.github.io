*The beauty of math, science, and technology lies in their endless possibilities. Every problem is an invitation to explore, learn, and innovate.* 


## About me
___  


I am a **Ph.D. candidate** in the [Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://ecse.rpi.edu/), specializing in **machine learning, optimization and occupant-centric control systems**. My research focuses on:

- Developing **optimization methods** for machine learning
- Creating **sample-efficient, safe policy learning algorithms**
- Evaluating **safety of trained policies**
- Designing **physics-inspired, data-driven models** for cyber-physical systems

I have experience in **large-scale data analysis, advanced machine learning** techniques, and **cloud computing platforms**.

### Key Projects
1. **Automating Safe Reinforcement Learning** (AIRC Research)
2. **Safe and Robust Prompt Tuning of Foundation Models**(AIRC Research)
3. **Off-Policy Evaluation for Safe Offline Reinforcement Learning using Offline Datasets** (IBM Research)
4. **Probabilistic Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for Large Language Models**
5. **Machine Learning for Bi-Linear Flow Models**
6. **Ensuring Safety in Multimodal Machine Learning Models**





## Education
___
* **B.Sc**: Electrical & Electronics Engineering - **First Class Honours, Valedictorian**
* **M.Sc**: Computer & Systems Engineering - **Distinction**
* **Ph.D**: Electrical, Computer, & Systems Engineering (2021 - Present)

## Leadership & Extracurriculars
___
* Executive Board Member(2022-2023), **National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) at RPI**
* Member, **Black Graduate Students Association (BGSA) at RPI**
