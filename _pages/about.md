## About me
___
I am a graduate student(Ph.D.) in the  Department of [Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://ecse.rpi.edu/).

My primary research interest lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence,  optimization, and control theory. Mainly, I am interested in developing: optimization methods for machine learning, sample efficient and safe policy learning algorithms, methods for evaluating these safe trained policies, and physics-guided deep learning models for learning the parameters of cyber-physical systems. 
Previously, I worked on developing evaluation methods for estimating reinforcement learning  trained policies on both safety and reward while leveraging offline datasets. 
Currently, in addition to studying the problem of automating hyperparameter optimization in safe reinforcement learning, I am involved in developing deep learning models based on the "physics" of cyber-physical systems (robots and smart systems) specifically  as a convolutional recurrent neural network.

Some of the current research projects I am involved in include:

1. Automating safe reinforcement learning 
2. Machine learning for bi-linear flow models
3. Physics-guided deep learning of cyber-physical systems
4. Off-policy evaluation for safe offline reinforcement learning (IBM Summer Research: 2022)


## Education
___
* B.Sc in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (First Class Honours)
* Ph.D. in Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering, 2021-Present

## Leadership and Extracurricular Activities
___
* In addition to my academic and research commitments, I've had the honor of serving on the Executive Board of the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), where I actively contributed to fostering an environment of support and growth for black engineers. Currently, I'm an engaged member of the Black Graduate Students Association (BGSA) at RPI. This role allows me to be part of a vibrant community that focuses on the advancement and well-being of black graduate students, providing both professional and personal support.
  
* Outside my  academic endeavors, I cherish my leisure time, which I spend indulging in various activities that fuel my passion and creativity. I'm an avid soccer and ping pong player, enjoying the competitive yet friendly spirit of the games. Furthermore, coding remains not just a part of my academic pursuit but also a hobby. Programming for fun allows me to explore new ideas and technologies outside the structured demands of my research, keeping my passion for technology and innovation alive and thriving.
