## About me
___  


I am an AI research scientist with a solid background in machine learning, optimization, and control theory. Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of [Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://ecse.rpi.edu/).
My primary research interest lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence,  optimization, and control theory. Mainly, I am interested in developing: optimization methods for machine learning, sample efficient and safe policy learning algorithms, methods for evaluating these safe trained policies, and physics-Inspired data driven methods for modeling and control  of cyber-physical systems.
I have diverse experience in working with and analyzing large datasets, applying advanced machine learning techniques, and leveraging cloud computing platforms like Google Cloud and AWS.

Some of the past and current research projects I am involved in include:

1. Automating safe reinforcement learning (AIRC Research)
2. Off-policy evaluation for safe offline reinforcement learning (IBM Summer Research)
3. Probabilistic Methods for Low rank adaptation(LORA) of Large Language methods
4. Machine learning for bi-linear flow models
5. Safety of multimodal machine learning models




## Education
___
* B.Sc: Electrical and Electronic Engineering (First Class Honours)
* M.Sc: Computer and Systems Engineering (Distinction)
* Ph.D: Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering 2021-Present

## Leadership and Extracurricular Activities
___
* In addition to my academic and research commitments, I've had the honor of serving on the Executive Board of the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), where I actively contributed to fostering an environment of support and growth for black engineers. Currently, I'm an engaged member of the Black Graduate Students Association (BGSA) at RPI. 
  
* Outside my  academic endeavors, I cherish my leisure time, which I spend indulging in various activities that fuel my passion and creativity. I'm an avid soccer and ping pong player, enjoying the competitive yet friendly spirit of the games. Furthermore, coding remains not just a part of my academic pursuit but also a hobby, keeping my passion for technology and innovation alive and thriving.
