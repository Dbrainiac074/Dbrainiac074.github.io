- Course Description:
> The course provides an in-depth study of the technologies and protocols involved in building the Internet-of-Things (IoT), with specific focus on networking at the edge of the Internet. This includes understanding of wireless communication and link layer technologies, multi-access and scheduling mechanisms, mobility models, routing in disconnected networks, energy-efficient edge networking, loss tolerant transport protocols, and their applications to emerging areas such as vehicular networks, RFID systems and smart buildings. The course also discusses IoT Security and data/content distribution, aggregation, and compression. This course has a strong emphasis on hands-on experience utilizing Raspberry Pi’s, Arduino’s, and NI software radio boards, and a significant part of the course assessment will be based on a final project focused on building a wireless based application such as indoor localization for IoT devices.
